# QA_Manual_tests



### `Description `
---
The system under test is a demo of an employee management system, available at
- https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/.
  
It provides a platform for evaluating various functionalities, including user interface, data management, role-based permissions, and overall system performance. Manual tests will be performed with at least two different permissions to cover a wide range of system features and perspectives.

### `Main parameters for the tests`
---
The tests will focus on assessing user authentication, access control mechanisms, role-specific interface elements, data manipulation capabilities, and system responses to varying permission levels. Additionally, "end-to-end" tests will be designed to ensure seamless interaction between different roles within the system.

### `Tools used `
---
The primary tools utilized for testing include a web browser (such as Chrome or Firefox) for accessing and interacting with the system, and Practitest, a test management platform, to organize test conditions and test cases collaboratively.
